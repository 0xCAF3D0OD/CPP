* For this exercise we use /ifstream who display data from a file and /ofstream who write in a file.
* we take the first parameter to take the name of the right file who exist in the directory.
* we create with /ofstream a new file but with ".replace" at the end.
* then we use /getline, getline stock a line in a string => there it's "line".
* so yet line has the first line of the file "filename" then we verify if the args are note empty.
* Yet we replace all the word "str1" there are contained in the line and replace it with "str2"
  and we place the modified line in the new "filename.replace".



* pointer to function member: 
* I call it in the header.
* I use first an array with the key word, I use an array to use it then in the loop for compare the values
* Then it's the turn for our pointer to the member function, I make an alias in the header with typedef, so I can use Krn in my function.
* I use a length to stock the 4 addresses from my classe function, they have all a place in the array, so when
my function compare fund a similitude in the input the idx match with the adresse of the place from the good function.
* If I write INFO in my terminal the loop turn 2 time and the comparing function find a similitude, so it's entering the condition
  and the function complain who hase the same index entering the right function 
  
  â†’ Karen::info(){}
* How work the pointer to member function you create a function who has a type a name and a parameter
  this function take a reference from a another function, you can use this new function to make a similitude
  action it reducing the redondance of the work.
