## Polymorphisme Ad-hoc (surcharge d'opérateur)

* **SURCHARGE** 

  the capacity to rename a function with the same name from another function.
  

* **OPERATOR** 

  the signe do you put after the name of the function; +, -, =, ==, +=, -=, etc. ... .
  

* **EXEMPLE**
  
  * `a + b` can be write as a function; "operator+( a, b )" or a instance who call function operator; a.operator+( b ), + is a operator.

  * `-a` can be write as a function;"operator-( a )" or a instance who call function operator; a.operator-( void ), - is a operator.

  * `++a` can be write as a function; "operator++( a )" or a instance who call function operator; a.operator++( void ), ++ is a operator.

  * `std::cout << a` can be write as function; "operator<<( cout, a )" or a instance who call function operator; cout.operator<<( a ).

  * `a = b` can be only write as an instance who call function operator; a.operator=( b ).


* **EXTERNE (outdoor the classe)**
  
  *Is when you call a function.*	
  
  **`Complexe operator+( Complexe, Complexe )` =>	`operator+( a, b )`**
  
  cout << z1 worth operator<<( cout, z1 ).


* **INTERNE (indoor the classe)**

  *is when you call the instance.*	
  
  **`Complexe operator+(Complexe) const` =>		`"a.operator+(b)"`**
  
  How to know when you must use intern or extern: when you must modify value from the classe it's better to use the intern methode
  when you don't modifie a value you can use the extern methode directly.


* ***why "const integer operator+(integer, integer const&);" ?***
  
  it's block the possibility to modifie the result of a function.


* ***why "ostream& operator<<(ostream& sortie, complexe const& z);" ?***

  it's the same as `operator<<(cout << z1, endl)` who is the same as `operator<<(operator <<(cout << z1), endl)`.

  The second operator is at the **first place in the parameter**, so it must be the same type as the first argument "ostream& operator" it give the possibility to repeat the the "<<" operator.
  
  Ex: `std::cout << "je " << "suis " << "là" << std::endl;` without `ostream& operator<<(ostream& sortie, ...`" **it's impossible to repeat the process.**
  
  "permet la répétition d'appel à l'opérateur d'affichage".

* ***which type for a += operator ?***

  if the type to return exist already, it will be important to use the same type

  Ex:	complexe operator+=(complexe z1, complexe const &z2
  * `z3 = z1 += z2	=> z3` take the result of `z1 = z1 + z2 so z1` take the result of himself `+ z2`, the result for `z3` is the same as `z1`,
  `z1` has already a type complexe so for taking the same complexe you add a '&' => `complexe& complexe::operator+=(complexe const& z2);`
  => returning the value of the adresse it must return the `instance courante => pointeur sur adresse` => `return *this`
  
* **opérateur d'affectation (=)**	
 
  `EnormeClasse& operator=(EnormeClasse const&) => a.operator=(b, c)` this is equivalent to `a = b = c`	=>	this is equivalent to `a = (b = c)`. 
  
  The classe exist already so a and b is the same type so the return value is the same type as the classe, 
  so to avoid a new copy of a existant type we use the reference to use the existant type.



## flying point number (nombre à virgule)

* To compact big number, it's easier for the computer to manage them. flying point consist of multiply 1 or 2 by power 2.
* the power is the "exposant", it's a number powered by 2: 10^2, 10^4, 10^6, 10^18, 10^32, etc. ... . he's size is 8 for 32 bits architecture and
  11 in 64 bits.
* for the mantisse => in 1,XXXXX * 10^(e) (e = exposant) the mantisse is the XXXXX party he is composed of 23 bits in a 32 bits architecture and
  52 bits in 64 bits.


* "Roundf" return the integral value that is nearest to "(value * (1 << Fixed::_fractbits))"
  with halfway cases rounded away from zero. => avec des cas intermédiaires arrondis à partir de zéro. 

* the return : The value of x rounded to the nearest integral (as a floating-point value).


* ***What is a flying point number for the computer (nombre à virgule)?!!***
  
  * The memory of the computer is limited when we talk about an real number or decimal number it exists an infinity of them.
  impossible to stock all the numbers.


* ***What is a Whole number ?!!***

  * the Whole number are the number who don't take a comma.
  * In the computer we use a binary system (base 2 => 1 and 0).
